# Blog-website
This is my truly first website. I created that to learn how to write websites and to make a note of project I made.
Link to the website: https://bogusz.netlify.com
You can find here the snake-game, the weather-app and in future much more. Curently I write again a snake-game, learn webpack and ES6. 
Interesting here is that backend code and frontent code are on two diffrent servers. That one is a frontend source code.

## Project on a website:
- snake game written in vanilla JS without framework. 
- Weather app, where you can check actual weather and temperature predicion for the next 48 hours or next 7 days.

## In the project i use:
- SASS      (https://github.com/bogusz2233/Blog-website/tree/master/sass)
- NPM   
- Webpack   (https://github.com/bogusz2233/Blog-website/blob/master/webpack.config.js)
